# FsOpenTelemetry

## What is this?

FsOpenTelemetry is a single file you can copy paste or add through [Paket Github dependencies](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html) to provide your F# library with safe helpers for Activity and ActivitySource.

## Why does this exist?

One of the [best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/diagnostics/distributed-tracing-instrumentation-walkthroughs#best-practices-2) from the Microsoft Distributed Tracing documentation states to use the `?.` since "`activity` returned by `ActivitySource.StartActivity` may be null".  Since F# does not have this operator you have to put `if activity <> null then doThing` everywhere.  This uses extensions methods on an existing [Activity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.activity?view=net-6.0) so calls are straight forward without doing the null checks.

This additionally adds several additional helpers such as [RecordException](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#record-exception), [Adding many of the semantic conventions as constants](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/tree/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions), and automatically creating `Activity` with [Source Code attributes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/span-general.md#source-code-attributes) filled out.

## How do I get started?

### 1. Put the file into your project

#### Option 1

Copy/paste [FsOpenTelemetry.fs](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/FsOpenTelemetry/blob/master/src/FsOpenTelemetry/FsOpenTelemetry.fs) into your library.

#### Option 2

Read over [Paket Github dependencies](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html).

Add the following line to your `paket.depedencies` file.

```paket
github TheAngryByrd/FsOpenTelemetry src/FsOpenTelemetry/FsOpenTelemetry.fs
```

Then add the following line to projects with `paket.references` file you want FsOpenTelemetry to be available to.

```paket
File: FsOpenTelemetry.fs
```

### 2. Replace its namespace with yours

To alleviate potential naming conflicts, it's best to replace FsOpenTelemetry namespace with your own.

Here is an example with FAKE 5:

```fsharp
Target.create "Replace" <| fun _ ->
  Shell.replaceInFiles
    [ "FsOpenTelemetry", "MyLib.DistributedTracing" ]
    (!! "paket-files/TheAngryByrd/FsOpenTelemetry/src/FsOpenTelemetry/FsOpenTelemetry.fs")
```

### Developing

Make sure the following **requirements** are installed on your system:

- [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) 3.0 or higher
- [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/) if you're on Linux or macOS.

or

- [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)


---

### Environment Variables

- `CONFIGURATION` will set the [configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build?tabs=netcore2x#options) of the dotnet commands.  If not set, it will default to Release.
  - `CONFIGURATION=Debug ./build.sh` will result in `-c` additions to commands such as in `dotnet build -c Debug`
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` will be used to upload release notes and Nuget packages to GitHub.
  - Be sure to set this before releasing
- `DISABLE_COVERAGE` Will disable running code coverage metrics.  AltCover can have [severe performance degradation](https://github.com/SteveGilham/altcover/issues/57) so it's worth disabling when looking to do a quicker feedback loop.
  - `DISABLE_COVERAGE=1 ./build.sh`


---

### Building


```sh
> build.cmd <optional buildtarget> // on windows
$ ./build.sh  <optional buildtarget>// on unix
```

The bin of your library should look similar to:

```
$ tree src/MyCoolNewLib/bin/
src/MyCoolNewLib/bin/
└── Debug
    └── net50
        ├── MyCoolNewLib.deps.json
        ├── MyCoolNewLib.dll
        ├── MyCoolNewLib.pdb
        └── MyCoolNewLib.xml

```

### Releasing

- [Start a git repo with a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Scaffold"
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git
git push -u origin master
```

- [Create your NuGeT API key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package#create-api-keys)
    - [Add your NuGet API key to paket](https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/paket-config.html#Adding-a-NuGet-API-key)

    ```sh
    paket config add-token "https://www.nuget.org" 4003d786-cc37-4004-bfdf-c4f3e8ef9b3a
    ```

    - or set the environment variable `NUGET_TOKEN` to your key


- [Create a GitHub OAuth Token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/)
  - You can then set the environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to upload release notes and artifacts to github
  - Otherwise it will fallback to username/password

- Then update the `CHANGELOG.md` with an "Unreleased" section containing release notes for this version, in [KeepAChangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format.

NOTE: Its highly recommend to add a link to the Pull Request next to the release note that it affects. The reason for this is when the `RELEASE` target is run, it will add these new notes into the body of git commit. GitHub will notice the links and will update the Pull Request with what commit referenced it saying ["added a commit that referenced this pull request"](https://github.com/TheAngryByrd/MiniScaffold/pull/179#ref-commit-837ad59). Since the build script automates the commit message, it will say "Bump Version to x.y.z". The benefit of this is when users goto a Pull Request, it will be clear when and which version those code changes released. Also when reading the `CHANGELOG`, if someone is curious about how or why those changes were made, they can easily discover the work and discussions.

Here's an example of adding an "Unreleased" section to a `CHANGELOG.md` with a `0.1.0` section already released.

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Does cool stuff!

### Fixed
- Fixes that silly oversight

## [0.1.0] - 2017-03-17
First release

### Added
- This release already has lots of features

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD
[0.1.0]: https://github.com/user/MyCoolNewLib.git/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```

- You can then use the `Release` target, specifying the version number either in the `RELEASE_VERSION` environment
  variable, or else as a parameter after the target name.  This will:
  - update `CHANGELOG.md`, moving changes from the `Unreleased` section into a new `0.2.0` section
    - if there were any prerelease versions of 0.2.0 in the changelog, it will also collect their changes into the final 0.2.0 entry
  - make a commit bumping the version:  `Bump version to 0.2.0` and adds the new changelog section to the commit's body
  - publish the package to NuGet
  - push a git tag
  - create a GitHub release for that git tag

macOS/Linux Parameter:

```sh
./build.sh Release 0.2.0
```

macOS/Linux Environment Variable:

```sh
RELEASE_VERSION=0.2.0 ./build.sh Release
```
